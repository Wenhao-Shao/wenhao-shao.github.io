        <br><br>   
        
        <p>My solid state physics teacher, <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/physics/people/faculty/kurdak.html" target="_blank"><u>Cagliyan Kurdak</u></a> 
            at the University of Michigan, used to say that there are three prerequisites for lasing: population inversion, gain medium, and cavity resonator. 
            Intuitively, population inversion refers to the need for an excitation source to "pump" a significant number of electrons, excitons, or other 
            quasi-particles in a semiconductor medium into their excited states. The emitted photon is then confined within a cavity, where it can stimulate 
            the emission of additional photons from nearby excited particles as it passes by.
        <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>LASER, or light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation, continues to be one of cornerstone applications of semiconductors. In modern ages 
            when we discuss the miniaturization of laser devices in futuristic photonic integration, an effective cavity design initiates from a delicate 
            crystallization control over semiconductor morphology. Albeit widely used as bulk thin film lasers,  Group III-V semiconductors devices have 
            posted significant challenges during their miniaturization. Achieving comparable cavity performance at smaller scales requires advanced nanofabrication 
            techniques, such as high-resolution lithography and etching, which are often costly and time-consuming. These limitations have spurred interest in 
            alternative miniaturized gain materials that are compatible with low-cost fabrication methods.
        <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>Layered metal-halide (2D) perovskites offer highly tunable optical and electronic properties, making them promising new gain materials. Unlike III-V 
            semiconductors, cavity control in these materials can be achieved through bottom-up lattice design rather than costly top-down nanofabrication. 
            Using a molecular templating method, we enabled scalable fabrication of 1D nanowires from 2D perovskites, which act as intrinsic Fabry–Pérot resonators. 
            By selecting a tin (Sn) iodide lattice over lead (Pb), we optimized gain and achieved well-defined cavities that support efficient, low-loss waveguiding 
            (&lt;3 dB/mm) and low-threshold light amplification (&lt;20 μJ/cm<sup>2</sup>) at 80 K.
        <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>The compositional tunability of layered perovskites enables further gain optimization, for example by increasing the thickness of inorganic layers 
            (the <i>n</i> number) to form quasi-2D phases. This approach reduces exciton-phonon interactions that hinder optical gain. Recent studies have demonstrated 
            room-temperature (RT) lasing from <i>n</i>=2 quasi-2D tin-iodide perovskites, though with a threshold above 300 μJ/cm<sup>2</sup>. However, synthesizing 
            quasi-2D lattices presents significant phase purity challenges, which intensify as <i>n</i> increases due to the similar formation energies of different 
            phases. Achieving phase-pure nanocrystals often requires physical exfoliation to separate mixed phases, but this low-throughput process limits the 
            practical application of layered perovskite nanolasers.
        <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>We have recently advanced our molecular templating methods to enable scalable, deterministic synthesis of phase-pure quasi-2D tin halide perovskite nanowires. 
            By introducing an intercalated hydrogen-bonded organic framework (HOF), we achieved controlled crystallization, resulting in exceptional phase purity and 
            structural rigidity. This approach enabled the scalable production of quasi-2D perovskite nanowire lasers with low thresholds (&lt;100 μJ/cm<sup>2</sup>) at RT, high 
            quality factors (Q ≈ 3500), and tunable near-infrared emission (750–850 nm). Owing to their robust structure, these nanowires also exhibited remarkable 
            stability against Tin(II) oxidation in air, allowing for the first demonstration of ambient-stable RT lasers. These results mark a significant milestone 
            for lead-free perovskites and expand their potential in photonic and optoelectronic applications.
