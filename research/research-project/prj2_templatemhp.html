          <br><br>   
          
          <p>Crystals invariably grow from a medium, which influences their formation. Templated crystallization 
            uses an external template, like a surface or molecule, to guide the formation of crystals, 
            influencing their shape, size, composition, and even the type of crystal that forms (i.e. polymorphism). 
            A classic case is the biogenic crystallization of guanine in zebrafish. The morphology and composition 
            of guanine crystals vary by tissue: in the skin, they form square or hexagonal platelets that assemble 
            into organized stacks, producing iridescent coloration; in the eye, they adopt elongated shapes and 
            arrange into multilayer arrays to enhance light reflection for improved vision in low-light conditions. 
            The morphogenesis of guanine crystals is "templated" by genetic factors (Fig. 1).

          <p>Inspired by biology, materials scientists have explored templated crystallization of synthetic 
            nanomaterials since the late 20th century. In recent years, interest has shifted toward metal-halide 
            perovskites and the use of organic molecules as "molecular templates." Metal-halide perovskites are 
            a class of ionic semiconductors that adopt the classic "ABX<sub>3</sub>" perovskite structure (Fig. 2a), where B is a 
            divalent metal cation (Pb<sup>2+</sup> or Sn<sup>2+</sup>), X represents halides (Cl<sup>-</sup>, Br<sup>-</sup>, 
            or I<sup>-</sup>), and A typically consists of small monovalent cations, such as organic methylammonium 
            (MA<sup>+</sup>) and formamidinium (FA<sup>+</sup>), or inorganic Cs<sup>+</sup>. Their soft ionic lattice 
            enables solution processing at mild conditions, while compositional tunability allows for bandgap control 
            from visible to near-infrared, making them interesting light absorbers and emitters. With low-cost 
            fabrication and tunable properties, metal-halide perovskites has become promising alternatives to 
            silicon in solar cells, while interest also extends to solid-state lighting, photodetectors, 
            quantum materials, and photonic integration.

          <p>Compositional and morphological control are critical in semiconductor devices. In metal-halide perovskites, 
            compositional control primarily involves minimizing defects and impurities. While perovskites are more 
            defect-tolerant than silicon, which requires ultra-high purity over 99.9999999% (9N), their compositional 
            complexity and solution processing introduce challenges. For example, unreacted PbI<sub>2</sub> is a major
            issue in MAPbI<sub>3</sub>, a widely used low-bandgap perovskite for solar cells, as rapid crystallization 
            often prevents complete precursor conversion (Fig. 2b). PbI<sub>2</sub>, now as an impurity, is known to decompose 
            into gaseous I<sub>2</sub> and metallic Pb(0) under light and thermal stress during solar cell operation, 
            acting as catalytic sites that accelerate perovskite degradation and compromise device stability. 
            <br><br>

            Alternatively, crystallization can be regulated by capturing PbI<sub>2</sub> precursors and gradually 
            converting them to MAPbI<sub>3</sub>. We recently developed an ionic liquid as a molecular template 
            for this purpose. Ionic liquid is a type of organic salt with low melting point and usually behave as 
            liquid near room temperature, which makes them compatible with the processing of ionic metal-halide 
            perovskites. Our designed ionic liquid strongly coordinates with PbI<sub>2</sub>, forming an adduct 
            that mediates crystallization and enables near-complete precursor conversion. This controlled process 
            reduces PbI<sub>2</sub> aggregates, increases perovskite grain size, and yields smooth, low-defect 
            polycrystalline films (Fig. 2c).
            <br><br>

            Morphological control in optoelectronic devices extends beyond individual crystals to the spatial 
            organization of grains in polycrystalline thin films. While in solar-cells, grains need to be closely 
            connected and grain boundaries carefully managed to ensure efficient extraction of photogenerated charge 
            carriers, this may not be the case in light emitting diodes (LEDs), where injected charges generate photon, 
            or light, as output. Metal-halide perovskites, as excellent direct-bandgap semiconductors, can achieve 
            near-unity internal quantum efficiency (IQE), meaning nearly all injected electrons generate photons. 
            Nonetheless, external quantum efficiency (EQE), which concerns the photons actually emitted, can remain 
            low due to poor outcoupling efficiency (OCE), where a significant portion of generated light is trapped 
            within the device rather than emitted from the display area.

          </p>

          <p>Low OCE is a common challenge in continuous polycrystalline films, as light is easily waveguided to the 
            device edges. A smart solution to this is the formation of segregated instead of continuous grains. The 
            in-situ bottom-up formation of polycrystalline perovskite films can be templated by a combination of 
            substrate effects, additives, and solvents. Surprisingly, the careful control of these factors gave rise 
            to the spontaneous formation of discrete islands of perovskite crystals with controllable size and packing 
            density (Fig. 3). Randomly distributed perovskite crystals act as discrete emitters and scatterers, which when 
            combined with sequentially deposited layers, form convex structures. Due to the high reﬂectivity of 
            electrodes, these convex domes effectively function as microlenses to facilitate the extraction of light 
            that would otherwise be conﬁned in waveguide modes. This unique "discrete island–convex dome" morphology 
            resulted in dramatically increased OCE, and thus highly efficient perovskite LEDs (Fig. 4).

          <p>In summary, crystallization is a holistic process that discusses both internal and external factors. 
            Modern semiconductors come with considerable compositional complexity yet also brings exciting 
            opportunities for templated crystallization. The concept of "molecular templating" raised here in 
            metal-halide perovskites illustrates how complex control in optoelectronic devices can converge to 
            simple molecular reasons, and hence highlighting the hierarchical aspect of our molecular design.
