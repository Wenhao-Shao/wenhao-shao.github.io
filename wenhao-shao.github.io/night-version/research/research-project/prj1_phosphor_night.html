          <p>
            Metal-free purely organic phosphors (POP) may emit phosphorescence at room temperature. 
            "metal-free" distinguishes them from organometallic complexes, which generally rely on 
            expensive and toxic noble metal elements (Ir, Pt, etc.) as light emitting centers. The 
            key to POP design is connecting structures with excited state profiles to allow efficient 
            triplet excitons harvesting, which is generally governed by spin-orbit coupling (SOC) to 
            alleviate spin-forbidden triplet-singlet transitions. However, efficient SOC relies on 
            heavy nuclei to generate large electronic momentum, and absence of metal center makes it 
            extremely difficult to harvest triplet excitons from POPs. For decades, POPs, especially 
            in their pristine single-molecule state, were known to exhibit long lifetime in the 10 
            millisecond to second regime with low or negligible phosphorescence quantum yield at room 
            temperature, where considerable non-radiative decay competes with radiative triplet emission. 
            These limitations significantly restricts POPs' performance in solid-state lighting, which 
            necessitates a universal design rule for organic molecules to exhibit fast and efficient 
            phosphorescence.
            <br><br>

            We have presented a new design strategy for fast and eﬃcient POPs, named as the “heavy 
            atom-oriented orbital angular momentum manipulation” (HAAM). The HAAM concept envisioned 
            that the best ampliﬁcation of the intrinsic SOC constants could be achieved when orbitals 
            of heavy atoms directly undergoes angular momentum change during the triplet-singlet 
            transition. We found Selenium as a perfect heavy atom candidate satisfying the HAAM concept 
            where its soft 4p electrons could be readily coupled to nearby molecular orbitals and the 
            px-pz transition considerably varies the orbital angular momentum which, serendipitously, 
            sits on a heavy nucleus. The HAAM strategy was subsequently veriﬁed and benchmarked both 
            computationally and experimentally using a series of selenium-based POPs. Therefore, the 
            theory, simulation, and structural design nicely converge.
            <br><br>

            Impact of the HAAM concept was substantial in the community. As a direct bridge was 
            established between orbital angular momentum manipulation and structural design, the HAAM 
            strategy projected an expanded molecular library of fast and eﬃcient POPs and a wider choice 
            of heavy atoms including Selenium and even Tellurium. These molecular backbones demonstrated 
            near-unity phosphorescence quantum yield at room temperature and pushed the phosphorescence 
            lifetime below 300 microsecond. Efficient organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) with external 
            quantum efficient over 10% were demonstrated using these candidates. Our work also inspired 
            other researchers to continuously expanded the molecular library and optimize their 
            performances in OLEDs, sensors, and data encryption.
